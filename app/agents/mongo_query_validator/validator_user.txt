Original user message: {userMessage}

Analyze the results and determine:
1. Were multiple entities matched when the user asked about a single specific entity?
2. Do the results look correct and complete?
3. Is refinement needed to improve accuracy?

If refinement is needed, provide:
- Clear guidance on what to change in the refinement field (e.g., "Use exact match for 'Health Care Services, Department of' instead of regex")
- DO NOT provide a new query, only explain what needs to be refined
- Context about what was found
