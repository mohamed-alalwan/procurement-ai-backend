This dataset represents line-item purchase order transactions from the State of California's government procurement system, covering roughly fiscal years 2012–2015. It is not tied to a single company but spans multiple state departments such as Consumer Affairs, Corrections and Rehabilitation, Water Resources, and State Hospitals, showing what goods and services they purchased, from which suppliers, at what quantities and prices. Each record includes procurement context such as acquisition type (IT vs non-IT, goods vs services), regulated acquisition methods (for example Statewide Contract, WSCA/Coop, Informal Competitive, SB/DVBE), supplier qualifications, contract indicators (LPA numbers), and UNSPSC commodity classifications. In its current form, the data represents a public-sector procurement spend and sourcing dataset designed for spend analysis, compliance monitoring, supplier tracking, and acquisition method insights.
